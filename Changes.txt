unreleased
  Batch example: Raise exception when API key fails (quota, missing API key)
  Batch example: Raise exception when input file contains an empty line. Better
    early than risking errors later during the async geocoding
  Batch example: The CSV '1, "street,city"' were parsed as 3 columns, not the
    expected 2 columns

v2.1.1 Thu 20 Apr 2023
  Add python 3.11, no longer test against python 3.6
  Test suite: add pytest-asyncio to enable async tests
