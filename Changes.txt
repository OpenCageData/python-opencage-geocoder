  CLI: --dry-run prints an 'all good' message if no warnings

v3.0.1 Wed Sep 5 2024

  Requires python 3.7 and asyncio package
  Inititial release of the 'opencage' CLI tool
  RateLimitExceededError no longer prints reset date
  Batch example: warn if no API key present earlier
  Batch example: some errors were not printed, e.g. invalid API key
  Batch example: Check latest version of opencage package is used
  Add python 3.12, no longer test against python 3.7

v2.3.1 Wed Nov 15 2023
  New error 'SSLError' which is more explicit in case of SSL certificate chain issues
  Allow setting a domain name (only used in test suite)
  Allow setting sslcontext, for example to ignore SSL certificat errors (for debugging only)
  Batch example: Guess if input is coordinate pair, if so then do reverse geocoding
  Batch example: Give example of input file format
  Batch example: Ship CA root certificates instead of relying on those of the operating system

v2.3.0 Tue 04 Jul 2023
  Batch example: Raise exception when API key fails (quota, missing API key)
  Batch example: Raise exception when input file contains an empty line. Better
    early than risking errors later during the async geocoding

    expected 2 columns
  Test suite: Switched from Travis-CI to Github Actions
  Dependencies: Requests 2.26->2.31, backoff 1.10->2.2.1, because only those say to support Python 3.10
